      content="L2MRail has developed an innovative Wheel Impact Load Detection (F-WILD) system in partnership with RDSO, Indian Railway, Government of India. Our F-WILD system captures the wheel signature as a train moves over the instrumented zone of the track and processes data in real-time. The processed information is stored in secured servers (private cloud) for all authorized persons to view through a customized GUI. Information on the critically damaged wheels is communicated through messages to designated authorities. Our solution enables the Railway companies to monitor the health of all rail wheels that pass over the ‘WILD-zone’ and assists in condition-based maintenance of rolling stock, thereby reducing the maintenance costs while improving the rolling stock life cycle."

          <p>
            Two pairs of FBG sensors are strategically mounted at an appropriate
            distance ahead of the measurement zone to detect the entry and exit
            of a train. The trigger's location is determined by the FBG system's
            design, ensuring sufficient headway time for the system to initiate
            data acquisition. The sensors are multiplexed in series using
            ruggedized (armored) fiber cables, and they are terminated in a
            standard fiber splice protector. These sensors are routed to the
            junction box, positioned near the WILD zone. The distance from the
            entry and exit trigger locations to the measurement zone is 30
            meters.

          <h2>WILD FBG Sensor</h2>
          <p>
            The system comprises an array of 16 FBG sensors arranged to ensure
            100% wheel coverage. These sensors are securely attached to the rail
            using specially designed packages that can withstand harsh outdoor
            conditions. The FBG vertical load sensors are mounted beneath the
            rail using clamps, ensuring they do not interfere with the rail's
            normal operation. Each sensor is housed in a robust metal protective
            casing and installed at the midpoint between two sleepers. The
            armored optical cable is routed from the packaged FBG sensor to the
            junction box through an HDPE pipe, and from the junction box to the
            interrogator via a duct cable.

          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Each FBG sensor is multiplexed in series using ruggedized fiber
            cables. To monitor the train's left and right wheels, two separate
            sets of FBG sensors are mounted on the left and right rails of the
            railway track. The sensors are clearly identifiable, allowing for
            easy replacement or installation without much hassle. They are
            terminated in standard fiber junction boxes (FDMS) that meet RDSO
            specification RDSO/SPN/TC/68/2014, located near the sensing zone.
            The non-terminated ends of the fiber are then connected to the
            indoor equipment using ruggedized single-mode fiber cables,
            compliant with RDSO-approved ITU specification G 652D. The outdoor
            cables are buried at a suitable depth of 1 foot to avoid
            interference with any railway operations. The fiber is housed inside
            HDPE pipes in accordance with RDSO specification RDSO/SN/45/2006. A
            torque wrench is used to apply uniform tension and load to all bolts
            of the sensor fixture. It allows for setting a specific torque range
            for all fasteners. In this case, a torque value of 35 Nm is applied
            to secure the nuts to the rail. To prevent the bolts from loosening,
            a Loctite thread locker is used.

          <h2>Interrogator</h2>
          <p>
            An interrogator is an opto-electronic instrument used to measure the
            wavelength of light reflected from optical Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)
            sensors in both static and dynamic monitoring applications. It
            functions by sending light into a fiber and receiving the light
            reflected back from the FBG sensors. The optical fibers carrying
            light signals from the FBG sensors are connected to different
            channels of the interrogator. The reflected light's wavelength is
            then compared with the central wavelength of the FBG. When a train
            wheel rolls over the rail section equipped with an FBG sensor, the
            reflected light's wavelength shifts from its central wavelength.
            This shift is proportional to the strain on the rail caused by the
            train wheel. The data collected from the interrogator, corresponding
            to the wavelength shift, are then transmitted to the FBG Data
            Processing Unit.

          <h2>Internet Gateway</h2>
          <p>
            An Internet gateway is a network device or software that serves as a
            connection point between a local network and the broader internet.
            It acts as a bridge, managing data traffic between the internal
            network and external networks, allowing devices within a private
            network to access the internet. Internet gateways can be implemented
            through hardware devices, such as routers or firewalls, or as
            software solutions integrated into network systems.

        <p>
          The cloud server is a private server service from Railtel, running on
          the Ubuntu operating system. The server hosts the F-WILD website and
          includes a communication module to receive data from one or more DPUs
          installed at the respective F-WILD sites, as well as a data logging
          module to store the data received from the DPUs.

        <h2>Power Supply</h2>
        <p>
          The power supply installed inside the location box is a 230V AC to 24V
          DC converter and functions as an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
          for all the equipment, including the DPU, interrogator, and internet
          gateway. It has the capacity to provide power for up to 8 hours even
          in the absence of 230V AC power..
